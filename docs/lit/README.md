Lit review for SSLA replication special issue
================
RAP group
Last update: 2022-03-26

# Question

-   Why is it hard to hear an L2 in background noise?
-   Do early learners have more difficulty perceiving speech in noise
    than monolinguals?

# Previous lit

## AoA

-   Mayo, Florentine, & Buus (1997)
-   Meador, Flege, & Mackay (2000)
-   Rogers, Lister, Febo, Besing, & Abrams (2006)

-   Tabri, Chacra, & Pring (2011)

## Native vs. non-native

-   Borghini and Hazan, 2018;
-   Bradlow and Alexander, 2007;
-   Scharenborg et al., 2018a

## Level of abstraction

**Phoneme perception** (not word level):

-   Broersma and Scharenborg, 2010;
-   Cooke et al., 2010;
-   Garcia Lecumberri et al., 2006

# NOTES

## Mayo et al. (1997)

-   

## Scharenborg (2019)

> Imperfect knowledge of the language and the presence of background
> noise interact strongly to our disadvantage

-   What constitutes imperfect knowledge?  
    Seems unlikely that early bilinguals have imperfect knowledge
-   Focus has been on phoneme perception (native advantage)
-   More recent studies on work recognition (also native advantage)

Why though? Hard to say because of…

-   different studies,
-   different research methodologies,
-   different stimuli,
-   different tasks,
-   different noise levels,
-   different types of noise,
-   different groups of participants,
-   different language backgrounds,
-   different proficiency levels,
-   and NO systematic comparison of these studies

**Most common methodology**:

-   (16 out of 23 studies in review)
-   select a number of different SNRs,
-   present the target speech signal at a fixed level of intensity at
    these different SNRs,
-   and calculate the number or percentage of correctly identified words

**Noise types**:

-   Energetic vs informational masking
-   white noise has a larger negative effect on non-native word
    recognition than pink and aircraft noise.

# MAIN POINT

> These studies concluded that even early bilinguals who perform in a
> native-like way in quiet, are more adversely affected by noise than
> their monolingual peers, possibly because of interference of their
> other language(s). However, groups of simultaneous early bilinguals in
> these studies were often very small (N = 3 in both Mayo et al. and
> Rogers et al.), so more research is needed to investigate whether
> these results generalise to larger and other listener groups.

> In summary, early bilinguals and high-proficiency non-native listeners
> perform native-like in quiet and relatively easy listening conditions
> with low levels of noise. However, in more difficult listening
> conditions, non-natives perform worse than native listeners,
> regardless of their pro- ficiency levels and regardless of the method
> used to determine their proficiency (be it objective or subjective
> measures). Even early bilin- guals are adversely affected by
> background noise during word recognition compared to monolingual
> native listeners. **These results show the importance of the age of
> acquisition of the non-native language and proficiency in the
> non-native language on listeners’ performance in word recognition in
> noise tasks**. To account for inequivalent proficiency levels and to
> improve comparability of the results across studies, future in-
> vestigations into the effect of background noise on non-native
> listening should include objectively measured individuals’ non-native
> proficiency levels (see also Kilman et al., 2014; Scharenborg et al.,
> 2018a).
