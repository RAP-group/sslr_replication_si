# Big picture

**Speech in noise**

Less intense regions of the speech signal can be masked and rendered
unintelligible by extraneous noise in the acoustic environment (Helfer &
Wilber, 1990). Thus, speech perception in noise is more difficult due to
the decreased amount of acoustic and linguistic cues available to the
listener. Speech perception becomes more difficult as the signal to
noise ratio decreases. This is particularly true in one’s non-native
language, referred to in the literature as the ‘native advantage’. Some
studies show that this difficulty persists even when one learns their L2
at an early age.

**Questions**

-   Why is it hard to hear an L2 in background noise?
-   Do early learners have more difficulty perceiving speech in noise
    than monolinguals?

According to Scharenborg (2019), the native advantage results from
‘imperfect knowledge’ of the L2, but it seems unlikely that early
bilinguals have imperfect knowledge.

# NOTES

## Acronyms

-   SPL: sound pressure level (dB)
-   SNR: signal to noise ratio (positive: speech signal is stronger than
    background noise; negative: noise is stronger)
-   SSN: speech shaped noise
-   SPIN: speech perception in noise test (Kalikow et al, 1977)
-   SRT: speech reception threshold test, similar to NTL
-   NTL: noise tolerance level (point at which listener discriminates
    targets at 50% accuracy)

## Mayo et al. (1997)

-   purpose: determin how AoA influences SLA speech
-   test: SPIN (12 speaker babble, dont report SNR)
-   participants: simultaneous bilinguals, early-sequential bilinguals
    (\<6), late-sequential bilinguals (>14), monolinguals
-   n: 3, 9, 9, 9
-   languages: Spanish, English
-   L2 proficiency: no measure
-   findings:
    -   levels of noise at which the speech was intelligible were
        significantly higher for monolinguals and early bilinguals than
        for late bilinguals
    -   benefit from context was significantly greater for monolinguals
        and early bilinguals than for late bilinguals
    -   “early bilinguals…may not function at the same level as
        monolinguals, who demonstrate higher NTLs and steeper
        psychometric functions. Although early second-language
        acquisition is advantageous for listening in noise, interference
        from a first language may reduce even an early-bilingual
        listener’s ability to perceive second-language speech in noise.”

## Meador et al. (2000)

-   purpose: study word recognition in a second language taking into
    account cross-language differences in sound inventories
-   test: English sentences presented in noise, DV: # of correct words
    repeated
    -   pink noise, snl: -6, 0, 6, 12
-   participants: Monolingual English, early-low (7), early (7), mid
    (14), late (19)
-   n: 18, 18, 18, 18, 18
-   languages: Italian, English
-   L2 proficiency: none
-   findings:
    -   higher word recognition scores were obtained for early than late
        bilinguals
    -   higher word recognition scores were obtained for early
        bilinguals who used Italian seldom than for early bilinguals who
        used Italian relatively often
    -   ability to perceive English vowels and consonants accounted for
        a signifcant amount of variance in the word-recognition scores
-   notes: AoA in this study is mean age of arrival (not acquisition,
    and no cut-off), early-low and early groups have same AoA mean, but
    early-low reported less L1 use (8% vs. 32%)

## Rogers et al. (2006)

-   purpose: explore effects of early bilingualism on adults’ speech
    perception in adverse listening environments (noisy and reverberant)
    (few studies with early learners, they dont look at proficiency,
    i.e., Mayo et al, and don’t include participants w/o foreign accent,
    i.e., Meador et al)
-   test: CID W22 (SSN, SSN + reverberation)
    -   Speech Intelligibility Gain—Reverberant (SIG-R) Test (Koehnke &
        Besing, 1996), SNR: 4, 2, 0
    -   Noisy w-22, SNR: -6, -2, 0
-   participants: monolingual, early bilingual
-   n: 15, 12
-   languages: Spanish, English
-   L2 proficiency: self-report questionnaire
-   findings:
    -   poorer word recognition scores for bilingual listeners than for
        the monolingual listeners under conditions of noise and noise
        with reverberation, but not in quiet.

## Shi (2010)

-   purpose: effects of acoustic degradation and context use on sentence
    perception were evaluated in listeners differing in age of English
    acquisition.
-   test: identified target words in 400 Speech-Perception-in-Noise
    (SPIN, same as Mayo et al) sentences presented in
    -   noise (+6 vs. 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio)
    -   reverberation (1.2 vs. 3.6 s reverberation time),
    -   context (high vs. low predictability)
-   participants: monolingual, simultaneous bilingual, early-sequential
    (\<7), late-sequential, very-late sequential
-   n: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
-   languages: various L1s
-   L2 proficiency: LEAP-Q, self-report
-   findings:
    -   effect of noise, as well as the combined effect of reverberation
        and context, was mediated by age of acquisition
    -   simultaneous and early bilinguals use of context, by contrast,
        deviated substantially from the monolingual normative in
        difficult listening conditions.

## Tabri et al. (2011)

-   purpose: “bilinguals have a deficit in speech perception for their
    second language compared with monolingual speakers under
    unfavourable listening conditions”
-   test: SPIN test (12 speaker babble), SNR: 0, +5, +10, +15, +20
-   participants: monolingual, early bilingual (\<6), early trilingual
    (\<6)
-   n: 9, 13, 12
-   languages: arabic, french, english
-   L2 proficiency: ‘fluency’ in English tested: interview and
    questionnaire (knowledge and use)
-   findings:
    -   performance declined more rapidly in noise (at 65 and 70 dB SPL)
    -   Trilingual listeners performed less well than bilinguals, but
        not significant
    -   subgroup of five simultaneous bilinguals equivalent to
        monolinguals

## Lee (2014)

-   purpose: investigate heritage speakers’ speech perception in noise
    (SPIN) compared with second language (L2) learners and native
    speakers of Korean
-   test: custom SPIN
-   participants: monolinguals, late learners, heritage learners
-   n: 14, 20, 32
-   languages: korean, english
-   L2 proficiency: IRL korean test
-   findings:
    -   early exposure, even if limited, to the second language has a
        positive effect on speech perception in noise in the language
    -   Heritage speakers ability to perceive speech in noise was
        similar to native speakers’

## Reetzke et al. (2016)

-   purpose: dearth of speech-in-noise evidence for bilingual children
    who learn two languages simultaneously
-   test: pink noise, two talker babble, SNR: 0 to -16 dB 4 step
    increments
-   participants: monolinguals, simultaneous bilinguals (\<3)
-   n: 12, 12
-   languages: English, various L1
-   L2 proficiency: self-report questionnaire
-   findings:
    -   when age of acquisition and socioeconomic status is similar
        between groups, monolingual and bilingual children exhibit
        comparable speech-in-noise performance across a range of
        conditions analogous to everyday listening environments
-   purpose:
-   test:
-   participants:
-   n:
-   languages:
-   L2 proficiency:
-   findings:

## Scharenborg (2019)

> Imperfect knowledge of the language and the presence of background
> noise interact strongly to our disadvantage

-   What constitutes imperfect knowledge?  
    Seems unlikely that early bilinguals have imperfect knowledge
-   Focus has been on phoneme perception (native advantage)
-   More recent studies on work recognition (also native advantage)

Why though? Hard to say because of…

-   different studies,
-   different research methodologies,
-   different stimuli,
-   different tasks,
-   different noise levels,
-   different types of noise,
-   different groups of participants,
-   different language backgrounds,
-   different proficiency levels,
-   and NO systematic comparison of these studies

**Most common methodology**:

-   (16 out of 23 studies in review)
-   select a number of different SNRs,
-   present the target speech signal at a fixed level of intensity at
    these different SNRs,
-   and calculate the number or percentage of correctly identified words

**Noise types**:

-   Energetic vs informational masking
-   white noise has a larger negative effect on non-native word
    recognition than pink and aircraft noise.

# MAIN POINT

> These studies concluded that even early bilinguals who perform in a
> native-like way in quiet, are more adversely affected by noise than
> their monolingual peers, possibly because of interference of their
> other language(s). However, groups of simultaneous early bilinguals in
> these studies were often very small (N = 3 in both Mayo et al. and
> Rogers et al.), so more research is needed to investigate whether
> these results generalise to larger and other listener groups.

> In summary, early bilinguals and high-proficiency non-native listeners
> perform native-like in quiet and relatively easy listening conditions
> with low levels of noise. However, in more difficult listening
> conditions, non-natives perform worse than native listeners,
> regardless of their pro- ficiency levels and regardless of the method
> used to determine their proficiency (be it objective or subjective
> measures). Even early bilin- guals are adversely affected by
> background noise during word recognition compared to monolingual
> native listeners. **These results show the importance of the age of
> acquisition of the non-native language and proficiency in the
> non-native language on listeners’ performance in word recognition in
> noise tasks**. To account for inequivalent proficiency levels and to
> improve comparability of the results across studies, future in-
> vestigations into the effect of background noise on non-native
> listening should include objectively measured individuals’ non-native
> proficiency levels (see also Kilman et al., 2014; Scharenborg et al.,
> 2018a).
